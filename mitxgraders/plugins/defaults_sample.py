defaults_sample.py

This plug-in can be used to set course-wide defaults for a given grading class.

We recommend copying this file (so that upgrading the library won't overwrite it),
renaming it to defaults.py, and modifying it according to your needs.

This plug-in works by registering a dictionary with the appropriate grading class (note,
not class instance).

# Here are all of the graders that you can specify defaults for
from mitxgraders.stringgrader import StringGrader
from mitxgraders.baseclasses import AbstractGrader, ItemGrader
from mitxgraders.listgrader import ListGrader, SingleListGrader
from mitxgraders.formulagrader.integralgrader import IntegralGrader
from mitxgraders.formulagrader.formulagrader import FormulaGrader, NumericalGrader
from mitxgraders.formulagrader.matrixgrader import MatrixGrader

# These will be needed to set attempt-based credit course-wide
from mitxgraders.attemptcredit import LinearCredit, GeometricCredit, ReciprocalCredit

# These modifications are commented out so that they don't override the normal defaults.
# To use them, you need to uncomment them.

# Change case_sensitive to False by default
# StringGrader.register_defaults({
#     'case_sensitive': False
# })

# Turn on attempt-based partial credit by default and modify related settings
# This will turn on attempt-based partial credit for all graders
# AbstractGrader.register_defaults({
#     'attempt_based_credit': ReciprocalCredit(),
#     'attempt_based_credit_msg': True
# })
# Note that if you do this, you will need to either pass cfn_extra_args="attempt" in every
# customresponse tag or explicitly disable attempt-based credit.

# Note that registered defaults can be applied to a higher level class than where those
# options normally live. For example, to turn on debug by default in all StringGrader
# instances (debug is defined in AbstractGrader), you can do the following:
# StringGrader.register_defaults({
#     'debug': True
# })

# Precedence is given to the registered defaults of higher level classes. If
# register_defaults is called twice on the same class, the options stack on top of
# each other, overwriting earlier options as necessary.

# In this example, we make all MatrixGrader problems award partial credit by default.
# MatrixGrader.register_defaults({
#     'entry_partial_credit': 'partial'
# })

# You can also use this plug-in to make pre-built graders and functions available to
# all your problems. You just need to include them in the __all__ list. For example:
# my_grader = FormulaGrader(variables=['x', 'y'])
# __all__ = ['my_grader']
# Now, "from mitxgraders import *"" will make my_grader available to you in a problem
# You can similarly define custom functions etc, in the same way.
